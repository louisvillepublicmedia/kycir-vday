#Operation Make Love, Not Twitter War

Live demo: http://interactives.kycir.org/vday/play.html

More and more politicians are communicating with each other and the public via social media outlets like twitter. And sometimes, the things they say aren't so nice.

**Operation Make Love, Not Twitter War** is a way to bring attention to the things that politicians say over social media through a fun, engaging game format.

- you pull images of politicians
- associate tweets or short quotes to each politician
- replace key words or phrases with blanks
- the end user fills in those blanks
- the newly created text is placed over an illustrated background, like a card or canvas
- that canvas is saved as a .png so the user can share or save it
- all created images are displayed on the results page


##Requirements

This app is best deployed on a server over which you have control, like an AWS EC2 server, as it requires a few server-side processes.
